# EEE4119FF-Rocket-Project
Restarting this project because I hate myself


Instructions for use:
Load the Rocket Simulation/AsteroidImpact.slx simulink file and run the main.m matlab file to produce the results of simulation.

Asteroid Coefficient of Drag calculations are available in /Asteroid CoverM

Rocket EOM and Controller calculations are available in /Rocket EOM

The Rocket Simulation/define_constants.m file contains the initial constants of the rocket and asteroid system and the Rocket Simulation/setup_controller.m contains the two gain matrices. If the user whishes to adjust the gain matrices then they can do so in the /Rocket EOM file and adjust the gain constants in Rocket Simulation/setup_controller.m to what was calculated in /Rocket EOM
