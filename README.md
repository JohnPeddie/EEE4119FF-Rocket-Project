Instructions for use:
Load the Rocket Simulation/AsteroidImpact.slx simulink file and run the main.m matlab file to produce the results of simulation.

Asteroid Coefficient of Drag calculations are available in /Asteroid CoverM

Rocket EOM and Controller calculations are available in /Rocket EOM

The Rocket Simulation/define_constants.m file contains the initial constants of the rocket and asteroid system as well as the two gain matrices. If the user whishes to adjust the gain matrices then they can do so in the /Rocket EOM file and adjust the gain constants in Rocket Simulation/define_constants.m to what was calculated in /Rocket EOM
